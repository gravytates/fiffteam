# Node.js Google Maps Example
**(with the help of the [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [Path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path), and [Jade](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jade) modules)**

This is a simple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) app that uses the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to create 2 map views, each centered over Downtown Portland, OR. The points on the map are created by parsing JSON documents.
